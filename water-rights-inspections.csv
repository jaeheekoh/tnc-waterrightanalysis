Mr. Duncan is going to submit an initial statement and a livestock stockpond registration form.

Billy Duncan informed Water Rights staff on September 6, 2012, that his pond is filled only with spring water.  It is a pit-type reservoir so there is no dam.  The stream just south of the property does not supply the pond.

On February 20, 2013, Division staff conducted a field investigation.  It was concluded that the Duncan Reservoir collects spring water but has been abandoned for many years.  Therefore, this is a jurisdictional, non-consumptive use pond.  On February 25, 2013, it was decided by management to keep this investigation open since it is currently undecided as to whether the property owner should file a non-consumptive use reservoir.","S022753,UN000461"

Licensee appears to be complying with the bypass flow requirements, but due to the shifting nature of the Navarro River at the POD, Licensee maintains that the alternative method of measuring flow to ensure compliance with the bypass term, as described in the terms and conditions of the license, does not work as intended. Licensee re-rates the stream periodically during the diversion season and sets the adjustable pump intake to ensure that the bypass flow is met.  Licensee maintains a Stage/Flow relationship table and uses a staff gauge at the POD to determine flows when diversions occur.  This method appears to be sound and reasonable, but technically does not comply with all of the terms and conditions.  Licensee was asked to submit a plan (within 45 days from report date) for approval describing how they will ensure compliance with the bypass flow and measuring device requirements in the future. Husch submitted a plan in April 2014, but due to the drought emergency efforts, staff did not review the plan for approval. After reviewing the plan in September 2017, staff requested revisions be made to the plan.

The roadside inspection conducted by Jim Barton on August 6, 2014, found irrigation is occurring but could not confirm the source of water.

I made a  cursory review of the possible unauthorized diversion under curtailed water right A013487 (primary owner Gary Rumiano).  I checked eWRIMS and found in addition to the post-1914 appropriative right, Mr. Rumiano has filed the following four statements:
?	S018670 ? Deer Creek - from Stanford Vina Ranch Irrigation Company ? since 1848 ? up to the entire flow.  Decreed right
?	S023166 - Deer Creek - from Cone-Kimball Ditch ? since 1848 ? up to the entire flow.  Decreed right
?	S023651 ? Deer Creek - from Rumiano Farms ? since 1848 ? up to the entire flow.  Decreed right
?	S023647 ? Sacramento River ? riparian and pre-1914 claim ? since 1848 ? up to the entire flow. 

The place of use is located on Tehama County Parcel No. 079-180-07-1.  Based on the USGS topo map (see attached), Mr. Rumiano?s claim to a riparian right on a significant portion of the parcel appears reasonable.
Also, the flow in Deer Creek today measured at the USGS Gaging Station No. 11383500 is 61 cfs.  Therefore, it appears some water is available for Mr. Rumiano to divert under his decreed rights.

2/5/2019 Reveiw to close complaint:
The complaint was closed as of 4/22/2016 as detailed by a letter sent to Igo-Ono Community Services District (IOCSD). The results of multiple inspections concluded that although there was potential for unauthorized diversion in the form of Minoletti's diversion exceeding his decreed amount (0.8 cfs), no evidence was provided that Minoletti was diverting above 0.8 cfs. The complaint revolves around Minoletti's decreed right and distinguishing the amount of water naturally available. IOCSD uses Duckett Creek to convey water for their diversion further downstream but has not provided sufficient evidence that adequately identifies IOCSD water from water naturally available. The burden of proof rests on the complainant. Staff research and streamflow data collected did not indicate a violation.","A000784,UN000971,S024871,S024870"

Matthew Beauchamp needs to file annual diversion and use statements from 2010 forward and pay annual fees for the last three years. At the time of the investigation, Matt was told of his responsibility to file the annual statements and pay fees.Owner is easily able to bypass water via a valve and outlet located on PIPE1 at the base of POD1. PIPE1 also feeds Reservoir 2 (RES2). Also, the owner reports that the flow in Curtis Creek usually ceases by May 15, the end of the license
diversion season. These two factors result in a low potential for an unauthorized diversion. The owner is not currently using the diverted stored water for irrigation, but is using purchased water from Tuolumne Utilities District (TUD) as an alternative. Division staff confirmed Mr. Beauchamp is a TUD Customer.

As stated above, Ryan Creek flows into Outlook Creek, Outlook Creek and its tributaries were identified as one of the highest priority Coho watershed in the Recovery Strategy for California Coho Salmon (2004 CDFG) Ryan Creek has recently been the target of numerous fish passage and habitat restoration projects.   

The Ryan Creek Watershed was selected by NOAA for a public outreach and education effort.  NOAA recently mailed all landowners in the Ryan Creek Watershed (2.1 Square Miles) a letter informing landowners of the resources within the watershed and known activities that impact and impair those resources.   

Ryan Creek landowners were specifically targeted because aerial images suggested that the landowners were riparian, did not have anything on file with the Division and had agricultural operations going on.  Specific agricultural operations activities such as dams, diversions and sediment/nutrient runoff have specific impacts on the endangered species supported by the habitat in the Ryan Creek Watershed.    The Division of Water Rights and California Department of Fish and Wildlife?s letter is an attempt to bring landowners along Ryan Creek into compliance with respect to Water Rights and California Department of Fish and Wildlife requirements.

Water is being pumped out of South Weber Creek where it runs through property at 4853 Starkes Grade Road. The water is being pumped into a decorative/recreational pond that is about one to two acres in size. 

The impact of the pumping is to minimize the through flow of water and minimizing any water below the pump point to virtually nothing. This time of year the water flow is minimal but continues to flow and provide riparian support as well as that for some vegetation. 

11/29/16 Sent letter of NOV and Inspection report to Steven Reedy.  Has 30 days to reply

Complainant:  Jean (or June?) Frederick
Respondent: Water Haulers
Summary:  June (or Jean) Fredrick from Rancho Tehema (I believe west of I5 between Red Bluff and Corning) complaining about numerous water trucks criss-crossing the town daily to supposedly provide water to the pot farms in the area.  

Tom P. contacted June Fredrick on June 26, 2014 to obtain additional details.  Ms. Fredrick did not have any specific information about where the water was being extracted or where it was being used, but she felt that it should be looked into.  She also complained that someone had planted an olive orchard between Rancho Tehama and I-5, which is irrigated with wells. I explained that irrigating olive trees was no an unlawful use of water.  I also obtained contact information for the Rancho Tehama Association.  During a subsequent phone conversation with Ms. Carrie Lee, of the Association, it was determined that the Association is taking action to identify the parties who are allowing trucks to fill from their privater wells.  This is a violation of County Ordinance No. 1617, and the Association is working with the County Department of Environmental Health, which is the local agency that enforces this ordinance.  No further action on this complaint by Division staff is necessary.  A contact report for the phone conversation with the representative of the Association is attached.",

Original Respondent sold the property and the owner (as of 02/05/2020) no longer puts water into the landscape feature and installed a pipe that returns water to original watercourse.

The Division received a call from Mr. Chris Brackman in response to a ¿basis of right¿ inquiry letter dated June 7, 2016, the Division sent to him regarding a potential unauthorized diversion on Evans Creek.  He said he is not diverting water but would like to make diversions.  I informed him not to divert water without obtaining a permit.  Since Evans Creek already has four licenses claiming water from the creek and the creek is a low-flowing spring that may be ephemeral, he would likely not be granted summer appropriation and only winter appropriation if available.  Mr. Brackman acknowledged, and indicated that he would not divert water without first applying for an appropriative right.

The complainant, Mr. Ray Ricciardi, does not use water under which he is licensed.  Mr. Ricciardi utilizes a well for domestic supply and indicated he no longer has a personal interest in the complaint.  Mr. Brackman is reportedly not diverting water, and understands he should not divert water without a permit from the Division.

The notice of violation letter suggested three potential paths to compliance, including obtaining a water right.  The Respondent voluntarily applied for a small domestic use registration.  The registration was denied because Water Code section 1228.2, subdivision (a)(2) precludes the filing of registrations for facilities served by water right permits or licenses for domestic or municipal use.

3900,9/5/2017,Field,9/6/2017,Met Chris Nelson on site. He is concerned about Reedy pumping the creek dry.  Creek was flowing during the field inspection.  Visited US and DS but did not go on Reedy property so did not see if water was being diverted to off stream pond and could not see if water was spilling from the outlet.  It seemed there was some diminished flow from the US to the DS but hard to verify if so and amount.  Told Chris that Reedy appears to have riparian rights.  We discussed riparian rights and advised Chris Nelson this may need to be resolved in court.,5,1,56,El Dorado,South Fork Weber Creek,Weber Creek,38.708776,-120.6436,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8473,Complaint,9/13/2016,3/8/2017,1,ENF02723,Notification of Violations and Voluntary Compliance,3/8/2017,Janelle  Heinzler,Water Rights - Enforcement,,,"03/08/17 Submitted Initial Statement and Small Dom Use Reg to DWR

Water is being pumped out of South Weber Creek where it runs through property at 4853 Starkes Grade Road. The water is being pumped into a decorative/recreational pond that is about one to two acres in size. 

The impact of the pumping is to minimize the through flow of water and minimizing any water below the pump point to virtually nothing. This time of year the water flow is minimal but continues to flow and provide riparian support as well as that for some vegetation. 

11/29/16 Sent letter of NOV and Inspection report to Steven Reedy.  Has 30 days to reply

The worker accomplished this by digging a ditch with an excavator and installing white plastic pipe. 
Then the worker backed his quad-four vehicle with the pump trailer attached, into the storm water channel, and attached an approx.. 4"" black suction hose to the gas powered water pump and a bright yellow water discharge hose from the pump to the white plastic pipe running under the access road to the channel between the ponds, filling the ½ acre and 2.5 acre ponds, which are approximately 6-8 feet in elevation from the storm water channel. 
Photos and video of this ongoing activity was witnessed and/or documented by George Perez, Dennis Jones, Liz MacDonald, Sheryl Carlucci, Chris Prevost, employees of the Innerstave Barrel Company (where the storm channel runs between the Leland property and Interstate), pilot Joe Tuminello, drone operator Skyhawk, Lindsay MacDonald, Richard Foster and others. 
On January 27th, photos and video of the taking of the water and storing in the ponds at Leland were sent to Sonoma County PRMD. 
On Monday morning, a load of dirt was delivered to Leland property and the worker, using his bobcat and buckets of import fill, began filling and repairing the damage left behind by the pump trailer. We can only assume the owners of Leland were made aware of the complaints regarding the storing of water from the storm channel.

there have been several downstream landowners that have informed the Division about upstream diversion(s) (this diversion in particular).  Because Little Arthur Creek is critical to the recovery of the federally listed S-CCC steelhead DPS, and because this diversion(s) is located near the headwaters of the stream, protection of instream flows in Little Arthur Creek is incredibly important as it impacts all rearing habitat downstream.  Furthermore, at least one of the diversion dams (on Vonumanutagi property) represents the end of anadromy as it blocks passage to suitable upstream spawning and rearing habitat for steelhead.

A relative Walter Robinson had my grandmother with dementia sign some paperwork prior to her death. He states this paperwork gave him legal right to re-divert the water off our property to holding tanks and to water his cows. He has already put cement and wooden structures in place to redirect water so it doesn't go into Seiad Creek. He arrived today with a tractor and pipes stating to my uncle Les Robinson he is redirecting the waterway. Walter was a US forestry law enforcement employee until he was arrested by federal officers for manufacturing/ growing marijuana as well as burn permit violations. He doesn't believe laws apply to him and will proceed with destructing the the waterway without intervention.

The complaint involved a spring  that supplied multiple landowners that was located on an adjacent parcel.  Ownership of the property to contained the spring had recently changed.  The new owner was denying landowners that used the spring access to the spring.  From talking with Michael the issue  had been resolved amongst the landowner and water users.

The complaint was closed as of 4/22/2016 as detailed by a letter sent to Igo-Ono Community Services District (IOCSD). The results of multiple inspections concluded that although there was potential for unauthorized diversion in the form of Minoletti's diversion exceeding his decreed amount (0.8 cfs), no evidence was provided that Minoletti was diverting above 0.8 cfs. The complaint revolves around Minoletti's decreed right and distinguishing the amount of water naturally available. IOCSD uses Duckett Creek to convey water for their diversion further downstream but has not provided sufficient evidence that adequately identifies IOCSD water from water naturally available. The burden of proof rests on the complainant. Staff research and streamflow data collected did not indicate a violation.","A000784,UN000971,S024871,S024870"

Kossack cites two appellate court cases regarding pre-14 claims and submits argument for his legal theory, but Enforcement attorneys rejected his interpretations.
Kossack also argues that the Division had evidence available to it in the original complaint investigation, by which to determine the extent of the pre-1914 claim. In this latest complaint, Kossack demands that the Division determine the extent of the pre-1914 claim or find that the diversion is without a valid basis of right. Division staff reviewed the document that Kossack refers to and found that the document merely presents flow measurements of the water supply in August and September of 1907 and an estimate made at that time of the probable maximum amount of water required by [a completed] plant. By itself, the information presented does not support a determination of the scope or the extent of the claimed right.  
While the recent complaint filed by Kossack did not include allegations of harm to public trust resources in his original submittal, Kossack subsequently referred staff to a December 2010 report by the State Water Board that listed San Vicente Creek among various streams that were identified as a high priority for conducting instream flow studies (Instream Flow Studies for the Protection of Public Trust Resources: A Prioritized Schedule and Estimate of Costs). Division staff interpreted this reference as a renewal of Kossack's previous allegation of harm on San Vicente Creek (see COMP-44400, 2015). Staff finds that this document provides no new information that would change the findings made in the case of COMP-44400.",S008351

We declined as there is no well log for the site and the geologic maps do not support such a finding.  In the new complaint, Kossack now claims that the diverter pumps surface water directly from the creek without a valid basis of right and that there is no reason to believe that the diversion is actually a well (even though the several documents that Kossack submitted in support of his earlier complaint all refer to the diversion as a well). It appears that Kossack has changed the description of his complaint in an attempt to get the State Water Board to take up his cause to restrict diversions from and water use within the San Vicente Creek watershed.

Review of the inspection for the license showed that an eight-inch pipe was to be installed in the dam. Upon conversation with Bronson, it was revealed that the pipe no longer exists. With no way to bypass the flow of the reservoir, a revocation could not be processed.

Louis Buell contacted the Division in a timely manner regarding the NOV left on site during the inspection on 6/24/19.  He had a cannabis cultivation on his parcel, but the source was a well.  When I spoke to Louis, he informed me the well was ~100' deep and is an artesian well.  The line out was below grade and was tapped into the side of the casing.  I asked him about the water pulsing out of the top (pump would kick on intermittently stopping the flow leaking out the top).  He said that when he had a new pump put in after he bought the property, the person didn't plug the hole in the cap where the pump wire enters the casing.  He does not live on site.  He mentioned that he was just growing a larger personal grow and has no plans to grow commercially, at least until all of the bugs are worked out in the agencies policies and requirements.

1) Division staff did not identify any unreasonable impacts to public trust uses.  Previous public trust investigations, including consultations with DFW, did not identify sensitive species or populations that would be unreasonably affected by continued diversion by KRWA during the 2014 and 2015 drought years. 
2) Previous complaint investigations (Verboon) have concluded that riparian water users in the Clark's Fork area may not have valid water rights in low water years because water would not naturally reach that area under dry conditions.  
3) Some groundwater users (Riparian Association) protested the KRWA licenses, arguing that the storage of water in Pine Flat reservoir under the license would eliminate high-flow events in the KR and injure the protestants' right to groundwater recharge.  While concessions were made to these protestants, in D1649, the Water Board concluded that the KRWA licenses and operations resulted in a net benefit to groundwater users in the Kings River Basin.  No provisions to mitigate lost high-flow events were afforded to water users in the Clark's Fork area.
4) After a review of KRWA deliveries, KR natural flow estimates, and the monthly flows in Clark's Fork over the last several decades, Division staff determined that the lack of water in Clark's Fork is more likely the result of low precipitation, than of changes to KRWA's method of operation.","A015231,A000360,A015231,A015231,A015231,A016469,A016469,A016469,A016469,A016469,A005640,A005640,A005640,A005640,A005640,A010979,A010979,A010979,A010979,A010979,A000353,A000353,A000353,A000353,A000353,A000360,A000360,A000360,A000360,A015231"

1)	The complaint alleges the water is being ""illegally pumped from Miner's Revine [sic],"" by the resident of 6225 Reba Drive in Granite Bay via a gas pump and a pvc pipe for the purpose of filling a pond.
2)	The address given in the complaint appears to be mistaken, since aerial images do not show a pond on 6225 Reba but do show a pond on the neighboring property 7791 Tall Pine Lane.
3)	In any case, both 6225 Reba and 7791 Tall Pine Lane are contiguous with Miner's Ravine, so both property owners likely can divert under riparian claim of right.
4)	The complaint does not indicate that the flow of Miner's Ravine is significantly impacted by the diversions or that the flow of Miner's Ravine ever stops.  Therefore, the complaint does not provide any information indicating that the alleged diversion and use are illegal or inconsistent with the exercise of a riparian claim of right.
5)	Since the complaint was submitted anonymously, we can't contact the complainant to get information to supplement the complaint.
6)	I did not contact the Complainant (who was anonymous) or any potential Respondent (the identity of the alleged diverter seems to have been mistaken) regarding this complaint, so there is no one to inform of our intent to dismiss the complaint for lack of information.
7)	Therefore, I recommended that we memorialize that we have dismissed Complaint 5735 on the basis of insufficient information.

A vast amount of diversion of natural water resources has taken place by this habitat destruction, raising road levels, stream diversion, illegal grading with imported soil, 14 million plus square feet of plastic covering the natural decomposed granite soils, with erosion and particulate concerns causing contamination of the surrounding protected habitats. The Riverside County Code Enforcement agent posted notices today after many community members raised concerns about this industrialized operation that has a blatant disregard for the protected habitats and our local ecosystem and has caused irreversible destruction on approximately 680 acres of land and the surrounding areas.",UN002164

The reason for my concern and according to the Garberville Sanitary District annual reports they submitted for 2018, for both their water diversion license and permit, they now lose over 14,700,000 gallons of water they divert from the South Fork Eel River, which is 1 Million gallons more than for 2017 and why I submitted my complain, i.e. they are losing more water, not less.

Please see attachment, its the difference in blue, between what was diverted under their license and permit (raw surface water) and or sold thru a meter (treated water). 

Here are the links to their annual water diversion reports (2018) submitted 3/31/2019; both contain a link to the attachment I provided:

https://rms.waterboards.ca.gov/LicensePrint_2018.aspx?FORM_ID=393499

My question now is the same as my complaint stated last year (COMP-39893); the lose of 14.7 Millions gallons of water from the South Fork Eel is not a beneficial use, whom does it benefit?

I know this process is complaint driven. However, I have taken the time and expense to follow the complaint process, to no avail, while literary 14 Millions gallons of water a year are going unchecked, mishandled and squandered on what? Rather, the water should be benefiting the Threatened, Endangered and Evolutionarily Significant Units and species, i.e. Coho, Chinook and Steelhead salmon! Notwithstanding, the South Fork Eel is itself listed under the state and federal Wild & Scenic River Act and Endangered Species Act for which it is protected.

This magnitude of water loss is not water under the bridge or the assumption and theory this water loss is ""acceptable""; it should be treated as a crime!

Summary of ROI conclusions:
The Kegg Meadow Project reconnects the stream system to its pre-existing historical
channels and does not involve a diversion from a natural channel to an artificial channel.
¿ Groundwater is not stored and later released from storage to apply the water to beneficial
use. Therefore, there is no appropriation of water for which a water right is required.
¿ Even if a water right was required, it is possible that USFS may have a valid pre-1914
claim for irrigation of Kegg Meadow, which may be senior to most of the complainants¿
pre-1914 claims and senior to all the complainants¿ riparian claims.
¿ The impact of the Kegg Meadow Project on available stream flow, and consequently on
diverters downstream, is minimal and represents only 1% of minimum available flows
during the peak flow season (April-June) and 4% of minimum available flows during the
summer (July-Sept).","A023025,A023025,UN002250,C004543,C004543,A002234,S016623,A002234,S023439,S023439,S023439,S015124,S015124,S016623,S016623"

The property has a dwelling and what appears to be a very large garden.  I found that although the complaint was against a man named Milton Wilson, I think it is his wife, Sandy Wilson Wolf, who owns the property where the pipe is located.  There are no water rights permits, licenses, or Statements of diversion in the vicinity, and the property with the diversion pipe and the large garden do not appear to be contiguous with either the Sacramento River or Middle Creek, although the respondent does own several adjoining properties that are contiguous with Middle Creek.  Regardless, the pipe appears to divert from a point about 300 feet downstream of the nearest property owned by the respondent that is likely mostly water from the Sacramento River, when the river is full but the creek is not.  Therefore, I believe that the respondent, Sandy Wilson Wolf, may divert water from the Sacramento River or Middle Creek depending on the water level of each at the confluence.

Division staff who processed the request noted that the Licensee's rationale included statements indicating that the diverted water is diverted from POD, sources, at times, and for purposes not authorized by the license.  

Based on a review of eWRIMS, in addition to the licensed water right, the Licensee has a Statement (S013427) that was inactivated in 2013 at the request of the Licensee, Paul L. Vandegrift, after the death of the previous owner, Lucian B. Vandegrift.  Additionally, Vandegrift is among the surnames of land owners whose property is listed among the authorized places of use for water diverted from Butte Creek under water rights granted to PG&E in the 1942 Butte Creek adjudication.

According to the last Supplemental Statement filed for S013427 in April 2010, the property has ""several springs and two wells"" which can be used in place of surface water.  The Statement also claims that water is diverted from Butte Creek and Meadow Brook under riparian and pre-1914 water rights.  The reported purposes of use of water diverted under S013427 was aquaculture, fire protection, recreation, irrigation, stockwatering, and domestic.  

While the Licensee may have other water rights that cover the PODs, seasons of diversion, and purposes of use not authorized in the license, it appears that Mr. Vandegrift inappropriately inactivated the Statement associated with those water right claims.  It also appears that there are multiple Points of Diversion which were never individually reported, as required in the Code.  The owners were informed of the need to file delinquent Supplemental Statements in 2013, and it appears that this notification was what prompted them to request inactivation of S013427 in August 2013 on the basis that all of their diversions were covered (and reported) under the license.

Mr. Taylor claimed that he no longer has grape vineyard and his pond is merely used for migrating wildlife. He requested the partial revocation so that he does not have to install water monitoring device that has a significant cost.

License 4611 (A015455) was initially issued for irrigation purposes and place of use of 10 acres. Later, wildlife enhancement was added to the purpose of use and the place of use was reduced from 10 acres to 4.5 acres.

Mr. Taylor property is 4.15 acres and consistent with his claim, I did not observe any vineyard or agricultural land on his property, according to LandVision and Google Map. I asked Mr. Taylor to measure the volume of the pond and he reported as 342¿ X 50¿ X 4¿ (1.57 AF). I did a coarse estimation of the area of the pond using LandVision and the pond area cannot be greater than 1.2 acres. So the volume of the pond is substantially less than the face value.

COMPLAINT:
Oregon creek in el dorado county is dammed at parcel 040 250 003 by Andrew j Vilicich. He is the owner of the dam and the owner of the parcel. He also has a septic system that is within a few feet of the dammed pond which is polluting the creek water.
WATERSHED: Oregon Gulch

Research identified there is an onstream reservoir filed under Statement S004615 which is indicated as a fishing pond. An unpermitted cannabis grow is apparent in aerial imagery, but likely source is from a groundwater well under WCR-1990-007537.

Referred to El Dorado law enforcement. Per Stormer Feiler, CES will not be proceeding as the cannabis source is non-jurisdictional. Referred at CES Senior's direction for non-cannabis enforcement to pursue unpermitted reservoir violation.

DDW issued a Compliance Order to Mill Creek Lassen in 2014 pursuant to the Curtailment Notice sent by DWR. Mill Creek Lassen protested the Compliance Order, in part, based on its argument that the riparian claim was not subject to curtailment.

Staff and attorneys for DDW and DWR met on September 21, 2020, to discuss this matter and came to the conclusion that, since the curtailment notices have long since been rescinded, there would be little to gain by opening an investigation of the riparian claim of right at this time.

I called the complainant (Denise Drake) using the number she provided on the complaint to collect some information regarding the case on August 7, 2020. The person who picked up the phone told me I called wrong number, after I asked I am looking for Denise Drake. I emailed Denise Drake on August 11, 2020, and asked her to provide her number so that I can call her, but I have not heard back from her. The email is attached to this INV. I called Denise Drake for the second time on September 21, 2020. The person who pick up the phone said again that I called wrong number.

We concluded that water extracted by Rancho California RV Resort is percolating groundwater and the Aguanga Valley is currently listed as a ¿very low priority¿ groundwater basin according to the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) basin prioritization. Therefore, this complaint is not subject to the permitting authority of the State Water Board. In addition, the Aguanga Valley is part of the Santa Margarita watershed which is a Federal watershed since 1960 and is within Federal Water Master authority.

This complaint has to do with an existing well pumping water from an area very close to a cluster of springs and two streams which supply domestic water for a dozen properties down stream. The springs and streams arise from the parcel adjacent to where the well is located. It is only a few hundred feet away. The water users have senior water rights recorded with the SWRCB since 1993 and before. In December we learned the owners of the well property have applied for a new permit to grow commercial cannabis. The problem is no well study has been done to prove that the well is not hydrologically connected to the surface waters. Its located at an elevation that leads us to believe it will take our household water when they begin to pump 1800 gallons a day during the driest months of the year. We were not informed of their plans until one week before the permit was to approved. We have been before the Planning Commission and are now appealing to Humboldt County Board of supervisors asking that they practice forbearance in the summer months in order to protect our household water supply.","NJ000343,D030319"

 Received March 18, 2021. Jeremy Wright wanted a voluntary revocation on License A018608. Upon further inspection, discussion, and office investigation it appears that POD/POU is on adjacent neighbor's property, not his (mistake at DMU). On April 9, 2021, a revocation notice was sent to adjacent neighbor (Wanda Elliot) to see if she wants claim water right. Based on this answer, ownership change will need to be made at DMU. Was not her water right, because no one is claiming water right, went through with voluntary revocation.

Laytonville Water District is selling bulk water to third parties outside of
the Water's District's Boundaries, in violation of California Water Code, section 1052.

The Director is Jim Shields, who is also the owner and publisher of the
local newspaper, known as The Mendocino County Observer. He
resides in the Laytonville Water District. The water is diverted from a
fire hydrant in front of the California Highway's Laytonville sub-station,
on Branscomb Road, one block west of California Highway 101.
It is placed in trucks that can hold 3,000 gallons of water per truckload.
It is represented by these water delivery persons that the water is
not allowed to be represented as potable. It is understood that much
of it is provided to the unlawful marijuana cultivation farms.

Thus, the marijuana underground, which does not pay taxes, has a
water supply.

The driver's are charged $20.00 per water truck load. There are no
formal records. However, it is seen that about 10 trucks a day, for an
accrual of 30,000 gallons a day, and almost 1,000,000 gallons a month
is unlawfully sold in violation of California Water Code, section 1052.","NJ000356,UN002730"

There is a large cannabis cultivation operation going on next door to my property. Over 500 plants last year and looks like more in numbers being planted this year. There appears to be no riparian set backs, property line setbacks and lots of ground disturbance. I have notified the USFS, Sherriff and cannabis control board with no resolution or answers to if this operation is permitted. There are buckets, jugs etc. of some sort of growing substances littering the property and tarps covering what appear to be piles of garbage. There is a spring that feeds the residents in the area that goes dry from this operation and what water remains is being diverted for this large scale operation that appears to be unpermitted. The person that owns this land has several connected properties. The addresses are 54, 175B-F, 204, 200, 91, 40, 50 Westgate Dr. Salyer, CA 95563 and 208 Riverside Dr. Salyer CA 95563.

Karen:
Here is a new complaint I would like for Chris B. to work up and look into.

I reviewed Landvision and based upon 2020 aerial imagery don¿t see and obvious water truck operation associated with a surface water body, but we should do our diligence and contact the complainant and Lieutenant MacDonald with DFW to determine if this is a surface water diversion being used for water hauling for cannabis cultivation- It does look like a pond may have been developed adjacent to the main road, but I see no surface water source near it that would facilitate diversion to the pond. We may also want to contact the Shasta River watermaster to see if they know anything about this property and its water sources-

Message from Alex Sweat (DWR):
Hi Stormer,

I just got off the phone with Lieutenant McDonald of CDFW in Siskiyou County and an activist in the Shasta River watershed. The activist stated that there is a water truck that is making repeated trips in and out of a parcel that is along the Shasta River. The presumption is that, the water trucks are headed to the Shasta Vista cannabis grows but that hasn't been established yet.

It seems like we will have to establish a few things, are we sure water is leaving the property and not coming in, is it a groundwater pump that is sourcing the water, is it actually taking water to cannabis grows.

Is this something that you are interested in looking into, or I can also try to establish a few more facts first. The Shasta River is watermastered so the next step I see is contacting the watermaster.

Let me know what you think! I know you responded to complaints regarding groundwater pumping to water trucks to Shasta Vista cannabis grows so I wanted to at least let you know and or coordinate.

The property is in Siskiyou County APN: 013-400-040-000

Message from complainant's attorney:
Attached is the photo of the truck going into the Bill Macke property. I can likely get contact info for the person who observed the repeat trips and surmised, based on facts I am not yet privy to, the destination is marijuana grows to the east based on direction of travel once loaded.

The person who took the photo is a neighbor and said the property only has a domestic well so assumed the pump necessary to fill a 4500 gallon tank, based on time on the property, must be the one he has in the river/riparian.",UN002758

KG (7/22/2021):
 Received March 18, 2021. Jeremy Wright wanted a voluntary revocation on License A018608. Upon further inspection, discussion, and office investigation it appears that POD/POU is on adjacent neighbor's property, not his (mistake at DMU). On April 9, 2021, a revocation notice was sent to adjacent neighbor (Wanda Elliot) to see if she wants claim water right. Based on this answer, ownership change will need to be made at DMU. Was not her water right, because no one is claiming water right, went through with voluntary revocation.

Ann Ward submitted her compliance response last week and denied cultivating cannabis on her property.

Ginny Roberts (active community member from Klamath Falls, OR) submitted a complaint alleging that Klamath Falls farmers (Walter Woodhouse, John Crawford) and Tulelake irrigation district (Brad Kirby, Marc Staunton) are impacting Lost River, Tule Lake, Clear Lake, and Lower Klamath Lake (in CA). Specifically: (A) Walter Woodhouse has plowed up and planted grain in lower Klamath Lake, which Ginny speculates is without valid permits. (B) Tulelake irrigation district manager and board members have placed a very large dirt dam in Lost River to prevent water from flowing into Tulelake and provide water for Board members to irrigate potatoes. (C) Irrigation District with permission of Fish & Wildlife (don¿t know which State) have begun dredging work in Tulelake wildlife refuge to divert water for potatoes farmers. Irrigation pumps are very close to multiple water sources near Tulelake potentially discharging pollutants into water.
