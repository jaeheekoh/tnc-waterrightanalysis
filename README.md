# DSS X TNC Water Right Analysis
# Background

The Data Science Society Social Good Team at UC Berkeley created a report and tool that can help better understand the recent trends in water right approvals, and to flag the most concerning water right applications in key watersheds that need further attention and potential protest from The Nature Conservancy. 

Within our summary report, our team tackled the following questions: 
1. What are the trends in the number and magnitude of water rights that have been approved over time?  Is it increasing or decreasing?
2. What is the spatial distribution of trends?  Are more water rights approved in certain regions or not?
3. Are there any factors that make a water right application more likely to be approved?
4. Does the number of protests influence likelihood of approval?
5. Can we predict if a pending application will be approved?

# Requirements
 
All needed packages can be imported through requirements.txt, and all needed datasets (Catchment and csv files) are included in this repository. Throughout the summary report, there is step-by-step explanation of each code block.

# Contributors
All contributions were made by the DSS Social Good Team: Jae Hee Koh, Tess U-Vongcharoen, Laeticia Yang, Bond Chaiprasit, Preetha Kumar, and Zachary Nelson.
